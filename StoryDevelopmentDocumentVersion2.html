<h2>The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M Story Development Document - Version 2</h2>
<p>Prepared by: Chris Jacobsen (datahead) </p>

<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Alex pushed through the foliage in the Amazonian rain forest.  Sniffing the air, he winced -- it almost seemed to stink.  He grabbed a thick layer of meshed vines and leaves and peeled it away, finding a yellow shaped stone.  Peeling more away, he discovered a grid work of stones, forming a much larger wall.</p>

<p>&quot;So it's true . . .&quot; he said.  &quot;That old man wasn't lying when he talked about the golden ruby . . .  This could be the greatest artifact ever discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>He spent the next hour peeling away more and more growth. He finally found an opening in the foliage to the right, allowing him to maneuver to a perpendicular side of the mysterious wall.  He stepped onto the soft soil of the rain forest and glanced upward to get a better view of the structure.  It was an ancient pyramid, but it did not look like any Mayan or Aztec structure with which he was familiar.  A dark opening lay at the bottom.</p>

<p>Alex stepped into the opening, turning on his flashlight.  He was surprised, however at what he saw.  It was a library, with bookshelves lining the walls and dusty books neatly lying in rows.</p>

<p>Stepping past row after row of books, he soon saw a glimmer of light.  Stepping through the hole he found himself in a strange world with vicious, furry creatures moving in the distance and wooden crates that floated in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked a voice.</p>

<p>Alex turned his head.  &quot;I'm Alex,&quot; he answered.  &quot;I stepped into a library and found myself here . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need to hide, lest the armies find you.&quot;  Alex glanced at the speaker, seeing a creature in the general shape of a fox, with dark speckled fur and ears that seemed to curl back.  &quot;Dr. M is tearing apart the cities.  He thinks someone has the Chronicles.&quot;</p>

<p>Alex stared at him in confusion.  &quot;Who is Dr. M, and why does he want a set of chronicles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are the Malevolent Chronicles,&quot; answered the fox creature.  &quot;They are the final, missing piece of his collection.  With them he will have the power to rule this world.&quot;</p>

<p>Alex narrowed his eyes angrily.  &quot;Has no one stood up to this 'Dr. M'?&quot; he asked.  &quot;No one should be subjected to this kind of treatment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has an army of monsters under his command and a factory to make more of them,&quot; explained the fox creature.  &quot;Besides that, many people actually respect him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would anyone respect a person like that?&quot; asked Alex.</p>

<p>&quot;Because he is the heir to the Great Library, the keeper of the books, and his Ph.D. dissertation is one of the most respected in the land.&quot;</p>

<p>Alex nodded his head slowly.  &quot;Many dictators have had a cult following; he sounds no different.  If he's using the threat of violence to control people, though, someone needs to stand up to him.&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, a furball, with brown colored fur and bulging eyes approached them.  The fox person stepped back, clearly startled.  Alex took a deep breath, ran forward, and leapt upwards toward the monster, his fist in the air.</p>
