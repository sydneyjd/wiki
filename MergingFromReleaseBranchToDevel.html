<h1>Secretchronicles Wiki</h1>
<h2>Merging from a release branch to devel</h2>

<p>At any given time we will several branches with which we are working.</p>

<ul>
<li>Master branches correspond to major releases that are finished and bug tested.</li>
<li>Releases branches correspond to efforts to complete a release, freezing features in the code to prevent further bugs.</li>
<li>Devel (short for development) is where anyone can come to continue developing new features at an time.</li>
<li>Additional branches may be added to correspond to major series of releases, each corresponding to features that break compatibility with levels/worlds in older versions.</li>

<p>This document describes how to merge changes from one branch into another. It gives the merge from release-2.0.0 to devel as an example but can be applied to other branches.</p>

<p>TO BE CONTINUED...</p>
